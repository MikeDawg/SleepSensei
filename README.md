## Features

* Creates a pattern of light that you match your breathing to
* Breathing rate is decreased during coaching session, so this helps ease you into sleep faster
* The maximum brightness can be adjusted on-the-fly
* 4 built-in profiles
* The initial breath length, final breath length, and session duration are adjustable for all 4 profiles
* Profile modifications are saved to the device's non-volatile memory
* One-button/knob operation

## How to Use

* Set up the Sleep Sensei on a night stand or table next to your bed.
* Turn on the sleep coach and adjust its angle to either shine in your eyes or on a wall or ceiling.
* Chose a profile and start a sleep coaching session
* Follow the pattern of light with your breathing (brighter = inhale, dimmer = exhale)
* Fall asleep faster!

## Study

I have been conducting a study to collect data on the Sleep Coach to see if it actually helps users fall asleep.
